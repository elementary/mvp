# Reference {#reference}

Now that you've stepped through the developer guide like a champ, we have some reference materials for you. This would be a great place to bookmark and refer back to when you have questions about elementary development.

# Code Style {#code-style}

The purpose of this guide is to provide clean and accurate instructions on
writing good code across all elementary projects. This guideline is to be
followed on every file, in order to keep our code consistent and readable. We
are also inheriting some of the GNOME's Vala guidelines to keep our code
consistent with other Vala programs.

If the guidelines here proposed are followed, newcomers to elementary
development will be more easily able to join the development and
understand code. Besides, it'll make it easier for all developers to work on
applications that they don't usually work on, because the code will be
consistent. Finally, as Guido Van Rossum said - "Code is much more often read
than written", so having nicely written code is crucial.

## Disclaimer {#disclaimer}

This guide is not finished, but has been discussed and partially approved by
the elementary contributors. It is subject to changes in the near future.

## 1. Whitespace {#whitespace}

There is no trailing whitespace at the end of a line, whether it's empty or
not. There is also no empty line after declaring a function:


    public string get_text () {
        string text = search_entry.get_text ();
        return text;
    }

White space comes before opening parentheses:


    public string get_text () {}
    if (a == 5) return 4;
    for (i = 0; i < maximum; i++) {}
    my_function_name ();
    Object my_instance = new Object ();

Whitespace goes in all maths-related code, between numbers and operators.


    c = n * 2 + 4;

## 2. Indentation {#indentation}

Vala code is indented using 4 spaces for consistency and readability.

In classes, functions, loops and general flow control, the first parentheses
is on the end of the first line ("One True Brace Style"), followed by the
indented code, and a line closing the function with a curly bracket:


    public int my_function (int a, string b, long c, int d, int e) {
        if (a == 5) {
            b = 3;
            c += 2;
            return d;
        }

        return e;
    }

On conditionals and loops, if there's only one line of code, no braces are
used:


    if (my_var > 2)
        print ("hello\n");

Cuddled else and else if:


    if (a == 4) {
        b = 1;
        print ("Yay");
    } else if (a == 3) {
        b = 3;
        print ("Not so good...");
    } else {
        b = 5;
        print ("Terrible!");
    }

## 3. Classes and files {#classes-and-files}

Only having one class per file is recommended.

All files have the same name of the class in them.

Separate code into classes for easier extensibility.

## 4. Comments {#comments}

Comments are either on the same line as the code or in a special line.

Comments are indented alongside the code, and obvious comments do more harm
than good.


    /* User chose number five */
    if (a == 5) {
        B = 4;           // Update value of b
        c = 0;           // No need for c to be positive
        l = n * 2 + 4;   // Clear l variable
    }

## 5. Variable names, class names, function names {#variable-names-class-names-function-names}


    my_variable = 5;     // Variable names
    MyClass              // Class names
    my_function_name (); // Type/Function/Method names
    MY_C     // Constants are all caps with underscores

    /* For enum members, all uppercase and underscores */
    enum OperatingSystem { // An enum name is the same as ClassesNames
        UBUNTU,
        ELEMENTARY_OS,
        VERY_LONG_OS_NAME
    }

Also worth referring that there should be no Hungarian notation, and no mix of
any kinds of notations.

## 6. Vala namespaces {#vala-namespaces}

Referring to GLib is not necessary. If you want to print something:

    GLib.print ("Hello World");
    print ("Hello World");

Opt for the second one, it's much cleaner.

## 7. Columns per line {#columns-per-line}

Ideally, lines should have no more than 80 characters per line, because this
is the default terminal size. However, as an exception, more characters could
be added, because most people have wide-enough monitors nowadays. The hard
limit is 120 characters.

## 8. GPL Header {#gpl-header}

# Reporting Bugs {#reporting-bugs}

One of the big advantages of being an openly developed project is being able to take part in public bug tracking. However, if you're new to working with public bug tracking, it can be difficult to understand how to report bugs The Right Wayâ„¢. So let's find out how:

1. In order to file reports, you must be signed up as a member of Launchpad. If you've been through our [development guide](/docs/code/the-basic-setup), you already have this covered.
2. Find the "Report a Bug" page for the app in question. Often times you can right-click the app in the dock, select "About", and then select "Report a Problem". Otherwise, you can search for the app on Launchpad, select the "Bugs" tab, and then "Report a Bug" on the right side of the page.
3. When filing a new report, launchpad will automatically check for duplicates. However, it's still a good idea to search the bug list to make sure your report hasn't been filed already. If your report has already been filed by someone else, you can mark the report as affecting you using the link on the top left of the report's page. Only comment on the report if you can provide additional useful information that may help track down the source of the issue. Do not comment things like, "I have this problem too" or "This is a really important issue".
5. If your report has not already been filed by someone else and you've reached the "Report a Bug" page, type in a summary and description of the issue and select "Submit". Keep in mind the following information while filing your report:

## Be Specific In The Summary {#be-specific-in-the-summary}
This will be the title of the issue in the bug tracker. It's very important to be specific because it makes it much easier for a developer or bug manager to search the issue list and helps avoid duplicate reports. A summary such as "App Crashes" is not good and vague requests like "Increase Performance" are not helpful. A good summary is something like "Notification is not sent when process finishes".

## Avoid Subjective or Ambiguous Adjectives {#avoid-subjective-or-ambiguous-adjectives}
This may sound like a repeat of the first heading, but it's important when you want someone to confirm your report. Don't say that something is "jarring" or "unintuitive". Instead describe what happened and contrast it with what you expected to happen. "The panel suddenly appeared instead of being animated in," describes the problem in a way that is actionable and objective.

## Be Concise, But Explain The Issue {#be-concise-but-explain-the-issue}
First of all, it's important to mention that bug reports should be written in English and you should, if possible, watch out for your language and grammar.

The most important thing for a report is that the developer must be able to reproduce the issue. If necessary, include exact numbered steps to reproduce the issue. Include relevant information like your OS version, any modifications you've made to the system (like changing your window manager or kernel), or the version numbers of relevant libraries like Gtk or WebKit. If you're reporting a crash, make sure to [include a backtrace](https://wiki.debian.org/HowToGetABacktrace).

## Be Prepared To Provide More Information {#be-prepared-to-provide-more-information}
If your report does not contain enough information for the developer to reproduce the issue, it may be marked as "Incomplete". Oftentimes, a developer will make a comment requesting additional specific information. If you do not provide that information, your report will eventually expire.

If you've reported your issue against the wrong app, a developer may mark it as "Invalid". If the developer knows which app you meant to report against, they may re-assign the issue. However, if they do not you must find the correct app and re-assign the report yourself.

If you're reporting a "Wishlist" issue, like a feature request, a developer may mark your bug as "Opinion" or "Won't Fix". Developers are often open to discussion about these kinds of issues, but please do not harass a developer for marking your report this way.

## You Can Get a Bit of Help {#you-can-get-a-bit-of-help}
If you're not sure about anything above, you are always welcome to our development IRC channel: #elementary-dev on irc.freenode.net. We might be able to help you track down the actual project where you should report the issue, or perhaps even aid you with any English language issue you might come across. Most developers want to help you make good bug reports.

## Don't Confirm Reports for Other People's Apps {#dont-confirm-reports-for-other-peoples-apps}
If a report affects you, mark it using the link. Do not confrim your own reports. Even if you are 100% sure that you are right, just don't do it. It's not good bug tracker etiquette. A bug manager or developer for the app will confirm the report when they are able to review it.

## Don't Make "Me Too" Comments {#dont-make-me-too-comments}
We mentioned this earlier, but it's worth mentioning again. Do not make comments that simply say "This issue affects me as well". This clutters up the tracker. Only comment if you are providing additional information that helps find the source of the issue. If you only want to let a developer know that you are affected, use the green link that says, "Does this bug affect you?" under the report's title.
