# Translation Guide {#translation-guide}

Localizing our website and apps is one of the places where the rubber meets the road. Adapting to different use-cases is a crowdsourced effort, all in the name of familiarity and getting communication accross to users.
It goes both ways, because now there are platforms that make it easy to translate too.

elementary OS uses a self-hosted instance of the free(libre) software translation platform Weblate.

* Sign up for an [account](https://l10n.elementary.io/accounts/register/), or use a [GitHub account](https://l10n.elementary.io/accounts/login/github/) if you have that already.
* [Select](https://l10n.elementary.io/accounts/profile/#languages) the language(s) you want to contribute to.

## Translating the Applications {#translating-applications}

Each app has its own resource [here](https://l10n.elementary.io/projects/)

If you found something that looks odd in an app, find the corresponding strings in the respective resource to make a correction. Should your preferred language not be translated already, or missing translations, you can help out with heavier lifting too. Either make suggestions for changes to non-translated or translated strings, or issue translations. Make sure you look out for what suggestions have been made when doing so. There is also a discussion field for each string.

## Translating our Website {#translating-our-website}

The website strings are [here](https://l10n.elementary.io/projects/website/).

## Guidelines and documentation {#guidelines-and-documentation}

When translating you may encounter a situation where you have to decide between several ways of saying the same thing. Weblate has a built in check for this. Keep the Ubuntu [general translator guide](https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/Guide) handy. For language specific issues, see the [team translation guidelines](https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/ubuntu-translators). Following these guides ensure consistency, while also allowing anyone to contribute.

More in-depth information about Weblate is available in the [documentation](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/).
