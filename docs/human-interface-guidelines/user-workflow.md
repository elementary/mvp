# User Workflow {#user-workflow}

Visible design is a large part of the user experience, but so is the user's workflow, or how they interact with an app. In this section, we cover a few important steps of a typical workflow:

* **First-Launch Experience**: What the user sees the first time they use your app.

* **Normal Launch**: What happens when opening your app on a day-to-day basis.

* **Closing**: What happens when closing your app.

* **Background Tasks**: How your app manages to do things invisibly in the background.
