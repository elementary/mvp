# Capitalization {#capitalization}

All textual user interface items, including labels, buttons, and menus, should use one of two capitalization styles: sentence case or title case.

## Sentence Case {#sentence-case}

Sentence case means you capitalize like in a standard sentence or phrase.

Only the first letter of the phrase and the first letter of proper nouns are capitalized.
Used for labels and descriptive text.

* ex. "Always open MPEG files with Marlin" next to a checkbox.
* ex. "Read news feeds" for the description of an RSS reader.
* ex. "This folder is empty" in a file manager.

## Title Case {#title-case}

Title case means you capitalize like a book or article title.

Capitalize the first and last words.
All nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions (as, because, although) are capitalized.
Used for titles, buttons, menus, and most other widgets.

* ex. "Open File" title in a dialog.
* ex. "Delete 13 Songs" on a button.
* ex. "Search Contacts..." in a search bar.

## Notes/Exceptions {#notes-exceptions}

Proper nouns should always be capitalized properly; this means that, for example, Google should always be shown as "Google," elementary should always be shown as "elementary," and MPEG should always be shown as "MPEG." If you're unsure how a certain pronoun should be officially capitalized, refer to the documentation of the pronoun in question.
