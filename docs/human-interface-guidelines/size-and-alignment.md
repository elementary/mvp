# Size and Alignment {#size-and-alignment}

Icons come in all kinds of shapes. To keep a coherent flow, we try to adopt principals of type design when sizing and aligning our icons. For a 48px icon, we do as follows.

## X-Height and Base Line {#x-height-and-base-line}
![](/images/docs/human-interface-guidelines/size-and-alignment/x-height-and-base-line.png)

A 48px icon as an x-height of 40px. The base Line starts 3px above the bottom of the canvas.

## Mean Line {#mean-line}

The mean line goes right through the center of the canvas. Its primary use is in aligning floating elements. If an element's height is an odd number, align 1px below the mean line.

## Ascent and Descent {#ascent-and-descent}

Some icons need to extend past the X-height. Your standard ascenders and descenders should be just 2px past the x-height. This is useful when you need to use more space to convey the same overall area (such as with circle icons) or you need to overlay a smaller icon (such as when conveying an action performed on an object).

## Exceptions {#exceptions}

Not every icon follows the rules perfectly. Mimetype icons ascend to the top of the canvas.

If you need to break the rules, you can still use the established lines to keep with the general cadence.
