# Checkboxes & Switches {#checkboxes-switches}

## **Checkboxes** {#checkboxes}

Checkboxes present a way for users to select items from a list.

## Usage {#usage}

Use checkboxes when users are making a selection of items. Make sure that a user can toggle the state of the checkbox by clicking on the label associated with the checkbox.

## Labeling {#labeling}

Labels associated with Checkboxes should usually be nouns or nounal phrases.

## **Switches** {#switches}

Switches present a way for users to toggle certain features or behaviors "on" or "off".

## Usage {#usage}

Don't use switches to include related items as part of a list, instead use a checkbox. Think of switches as acting on independent services and checkboxes as including objects in a list. This is an important distinction to make.

Notice that the option "Record from microphone" is a great candidate for a switch. You are enabling and disabling this recording service.

However, if there are two options "Record system sounds" and "Record from microphone" you are now dealing with a list of related items to include as part of a larger recording service (who's on and off state is independent of what services it includes). In this case, a checkbox is more appropriate to denote this inclusion.

## Labeling {#labeling}

When possible, directly call out the service you are acting on. Do not use words that describe the state that the widget is describing like "Enable Multitouch", "Use Multitouch", or "Disable Multitouch". This can create a confusing situation logically. Instead, simply use the noun and write "Multitouch".
