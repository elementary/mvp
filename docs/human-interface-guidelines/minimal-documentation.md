# Minimal Documentation {#minimal-documentation}

Most users don't want to read through help docs before they can use your app. Instead, they expect that your app will be intuitive and simple for them to understand without assistance. This is great for developers because most of us don't want to write documentation anyways. Follow these principals and you'll create understandable apps that save you a lot of work.


[![The most ridiculous offender of all is the sudoers man page, which for 15 years has started with a 'quick guide' to EBNF, a system for defining the grammar of a language. 'Don't despair', it says, 'the definitions below are annotated.'](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/manuals.png "From xkcd 'Manuals'")](http://xkcd.com/1343/)

## Use Understandable Copy {#use-understandable-copy}

Avoid technical jargon and assume little-to-no technical knowledge. This allows your app to be "self-documenting."

Provide non-technical explanations instead of cryptic error messages. If something goes wrong, a simplified explanation of what happened and how to fix it should be presented.Â
