# Text {#text}

Although elementary primarily uses graphics as a means of interaction, text is also widely used for things like button labels, tooltips, menu items, dialog messages, and more. Using text consistently and clearly both in terminology and format is an extremely important part of designing your app and helps add to the overall cohesiveness of the elementary platform.

* **Writing Style**. Keep your text understandable and consistent with the rest of elementary.
* **Language**. Keep other languages in mind.
* **Capitalization**. What, when, and where to capitalize.
* **Punctuation**. Avoid common mistakes and follow convention.
* **Using Ellipsis**. When, where, and why to use ellipsis.
* **Naming Menu Items**. Keep your menus clear and consistent.
