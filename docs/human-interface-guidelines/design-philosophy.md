# Design Philosophy {#design-philosophy}

The elementary HIG isn't just about a set of concrete rules; it's meant to be flexible and extensible. As such, this very first portion of the guideline is all about the guiding philosophy we employ. The main pillars of elementary design are as follows:

* **Concision**. Apps should be focused and to-the-point. As explained in this section, concise apps provide both a better experience within themselves and for the desktop as a whole.

* **Avoid Configuration**. As explained in this section, what's often disguised positively as "customize-ability" is actually harmful to the experience presented in your app.

* **Minimal Documentation**. elementary apps are designed with both developers and users in mind. No developer wants to spend time writing lengthy docs, and no user wants to spend time reading them.
