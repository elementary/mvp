# Writing Style {#writing-style}

Use the following rules to keep your text understandable and consistent:

## Be Brief {#be-brief}

Don't give the user a bunch of text to read; a lengthy sentence can appear daunting and may discourage users from actually reading your messaging. Instead, provide the user with short and concise text.

* **Bad**: It doesn't look like you have any music in your library. You can use Noise to organize your music, add more, and listen to the music you already have. To get started, click on the "Add" button, then follow the prompts. Once you're done, your Music will be displayed here.
* **Better**: Get Some Tunes. Noise can't seem to find your contacts. \[Buttons to import or create contacts\]

## Think Simple {#think-simple}

Assume the user is intelligent, but not technical. Avoid long, uncommon words and focus on using common, simple verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Never use technical jargon.

* **Bad**:37 audio format files have been successfully imported into the songs database.
* **Better**: Successfully added 37 songs.

## Get To The Bottom Line {#get-to-the-bottom-line}

Put the most important information at the beginning of your text. If the user stops reading, they'll still have what they need in mind.

* **Bad**: Your network connection might be down because Lingo could not find any definitions. Check it and try again.
* **Better**: No definition found. Check your network connection and try again.

## Don't Repeat Yourself {#dont-repeat-yourself}

Repetition can be annoying and adds unnecessary length to your messaging.

* **Bad**: Your email address, johndoe@email.com, has been added. To access johndoe@email.com, click on "johndoe@email.com" above.
* **Better**: Your email address has been added. To access it, click "johndoe@email.com" above.

## Use Visual Hierarchy {#use-visual-hierarchy}

Visual hierarchy aids users in reading and comprehending your text as well as knowing what is most important. Use headings and other text styles appropriately.

* **Bad**:
<p>No files are open. Open a file to begin editing.</p>

* **Better**:
### No files are open.
#### Open a file to begin editing.
