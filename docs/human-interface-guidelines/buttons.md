# Buttons {#buttons}

Buttons are an incredibly important widget to understand since your app will undoubtedly contain them.

### Labeling

Toolbar Buttons are almost always icon-only and do not provide a button border. They should not be accompanied by a label.

### Tooltips

All Toolbar Buttons should have tooltips, since they do not contain a label. This assists users with disabilities as well as giving a translation for an unrecognized icon. Tooltips should be done in Sentence Case.

Like text button labels, a tooltip should clearly describe what will happen when the button is pressed.

## Text Buttons {#text-buttons}

### Labeling

Text Button labels should be done in Title Case.

Like menu items, Text Button labels should consist of an Action or a Location but not a status. Make sure that a button's label clearly describes what will happen when it is pressed.

"Remove Account", "Transfer to Jim's Laptop", and "Import 20 Songs" are good labels.

"OK", "Get more storage!", and "Low Battery" are not good button labels. The "Get more storage!" label uses incorrect capitalization and unnecessary punctuation. With the other two labels, It's not very clear what will happen when these buttons are clicked.

### Tooltips

Since Text buttons have a clear and explicit label, it's usually unnecessary to give them a tooltip.

## Linked Buttons {#linked-buttons}

### Usage

Linked Buttons are used to group actions that are either similar in nature or mutually exclusive. For example, they could group text options like Bold, Italic, and Underline. Or they can be used to group mutually exclusive states like Grid, List, or Column view.

### Labeling

Linked Buttons should never contain colored icons. Only 16px symbolic icons OR text. Do not mix icons and text.
