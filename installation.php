                        <p>elementary OS is currently built for two processor architectures, 32-bit and 64-bit.</p>

                        <h3>OS X</h3>
			<p>Before creating an install disk, make sure you have all firmware updates installed. To check for available firmware updates, open the Apple Menu and select "Software Update..." or "App Store..." Install any updates labeled with "firmware" or "Bootcamp". Next, find out what Mac Model you have:</p>

                        <p>For Macs running OS X Yosemite or later, click on the Apple Menu and select "About This Mac". Take note of the year the Mac was build.</p>
			<img src="images/installation/osx_about_mac.png" alt="About Mac" class="float-left">
			<p>For Macs running OS X Mavericks or earlier, click the Apple Menu and select "About This Mac", followed by "More Info..." Take note of the "Model Identifier".</p>
			<h3>Compatibility</h3>
			<p>The following Macs are completely unsupported by elementary OS:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>PowerPC based Macs</li>
			    <li>Xserve Macs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For the following Mac models, you may choose to create an install USB drive:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>MacBook7,1 (Mid 2010) or newer</li>
			    <li>MacBook Pro7,1 (Mid 2010) or newer</li>
			    <li>MacBookr Air3,2 (Mid 2010) or newer</li>
			    <li>Mac Mini 5,1 (Mid 2011) or newer</li>
			    <li>iMac13,1 (Late 2012) or newer</li>
			    <li>Mac Pro5,1 (Mid 2010) or newer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Proceed to the instructions on how to create an Install USB drive. If your Mac is older than the ones shown above, proceed to the instructions on creating an install DVD.</p>
			<h3>Creating an Install USB Drive</h3>
			<p>Begin with a spare USB flash drive with at least 1GB of free space</p>
			<p>You'll need a small application called "elementary thumbnail creator". Download it from <a href="">its website</a>, uncompress it, and open the app to launch it. Insert your spare USB flash drive now if you haven't yet done so. Follow the instructions given by the app. You'll see a window looking like this:</p>
			<img src="images/installation/osx_thumbnail_creator.png" alt="OS X Thumbnail Creator" class="float-left">
			<p>To see the progress the app is making, click on the cog in the Apple Menu.</p>
			<img src="images/installation/osx_thumbnail_creator_progress.png" alt="elementary Thumbnail Creator Progress" class="float-left">
			<p>If your Mac fails to start with the following error "No Bootable Device -- Insert Boot Disk And Press Any Key", or doesn't give any option to start the USB drive in the Boot Manager, you may want to create an elementary OS Install DVD instead.</p>
			<h3>Creating an Install DVD</h3>
			<p>Insert a blank DVD-R or DVD-RW into your DVD drive. If your Mac does not have a DVD drive, you can use an external one, including the Apple USB SuperDrive. Please note that elementary OS is too large to fit inside a CD.<p>
			<p>Upon inserting the blank DVD, a box might appear asking what to do; click "Ignore".
			<img src="images/installation/osx_dialog.png">
			<p>Right click (or control click) on the ISO file you've just downloaded in Finder and select 'Burn "elementaryos-unstable-amd64.XX.iso" to Disc'. The date on the file might be different than shown.

                        <p>Open UNetbootin from the Dash in Ubuntu. It will open a window like the one below:</p>

If you choose the incorrect drive, your computer will likely continue to boot as normal. Just restart your computer and pick a different drive in that menu.</li>
                            <li>Shortly after selecting the appropriate boot drive, you should be presented with the elementary OS splash screen. You may now follow the on-screen instructions which will guide you through the rest of the process.</li>
