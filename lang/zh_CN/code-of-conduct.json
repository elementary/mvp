    "Code of Conduct": "行为规范",
    "Community Guidelines": "社区言行守则",
    "Being involved in the elementary community is an incredible experience; you get to be a part of something big, collaborate with people from around the world, and help people make their computers awesome. However, with that comes a responsibility to follow a predefined set of rules that ensures the best environment for all involved. The following rules are expected to be adhered to anytime you&rsquo;re involved with the community, be it on the elementary website, in an official IRC room, in person, or elsewhere.": "参与elementary的社区是一种绝非一般的体验；您将与来自全球的人一起合作，来帮助人们使他们的计算机更加完美。然而，这要求您有足够的责任心，以保证社区的运作环境。在您参与到这个社区之时，请保证遵循以下的规定，不管是在elementary的论坛，还是在官方的IRC聊天室，又或者是其他相关的任何地方。",
    "I. Respect": "1. 尊重",
    "Respecting others is paramount. Be sure to respect people and their opinions, personal background, privacy, and ideas. The elementary community is not a place for disrespectful or hurtful remarks for any reason whatsoever. When giving criticism, approach it constructively and respectfully. Personal attacks are not tolerated. When receiving constructive criticism, take it into consideration and thank the critic for their input, no matter your stance.": "尊重是一种崇高的礼仪。请保证尊重他人及其意见，个人背景，隐私，或是想法。elementary的社区不是一个可以口不择言的地方。在发言时，请勿发表无意义或是攻击性的言论。这里并不会容忍人身攻击。当收到一条建设性的意见时，无论您的立场如何，请将其带入考虑范围之内，并感谢他们的意见。",
    "II. Content": "2. 内容",
    "The elementary community is made up of thousands of users of varying ages, beliefs, and levels of maturity. Because of this, you must be conscious of the content you produce and the remarks you make. No nudity, excess vulgarity, political content, religious content, or inappropriate content should appear in relation to elementary. Ultimately, the elementary moderators have the final say as to what constitutes as inappropriate. If in doubt, consider whether or not it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;d show to a room full of people including children and grandmothers from around the world. If you&rsquo;re hesitant, don&rsquo;t do it.": "elementary的社区有着成千上万的用户，他们有着不同的年龄，信仰，或是人生经历。正因为如此，请您务必确保您的言论经过深思熟虑，它们不该包含有关于色情，政治，宗教，或是其他不宜的内容。如果您对您即将发表的言论的内容是否触犯该项规定而感到疑惑，请想象一下，您的言论将对一屋子来自世界各地的人展示出来，他们之中不乏有小孩和老人，这时，如果您感到犹豫不觉，请勿发表该言论。",
    "Screenshots shared in elementary-moderated communities should not contain themes that imitate another OS, photos or illustrations objectifying an individual, or content that otherwise violates our Code of Conduct.": "Screenshots shared in elementary-moderated communities should not contain themes that imitate another OS, photos or illustrations objectifying an individual, or content that otherwise violates our Code of Conduct.",
    "III. Rumors and Speculation": "III. Rumors and Speculation",
    "While the fast-paced and exciting nature of elementary contributes to the want to spread rumors or speculation, avoid it. Discussing future plans is alright, but anytime it&rsquo;s not a verified fact, disclose it as personal speculation or do not discuss it. Spreading inaccurate information can be detrimental to the community, especially if spread in a negative light.": "While the fast-paced and exciting nature of elementary contributes to the want to spread rumors or speculation, avoid it.

    "IV. Helpful Discussion": "IV. Helpful Discussion",
    "elementary is powered by individuals coming together in their free time to create something special. It&rsquo;s important to respect that fact and to always try to contribute to healthy, helpful discussion. If in a meeting, keep on-topic and stay quiet unless you have something helpful that pertains to the immediate discussion. If commenting on the website, keep the discussion related to the content of the Journal entry or Answer topic. If participating in a developer-oriented discussion such as a mailing list or developer IRC channel, do not create unnecessary noise by discussing non-development topics; this only derails the discussion and muddies up the logs for developers who may not be present.": "elementary is powered by individuals coming together in their free time to create something special.

    "As a primarily online-based community, it&rsquo;s important we avoid the potentially negative aspects of the Internet. Do not troll; starting fights or making remarks with the sole purpose of making someone mad is childish and unacceptable. Spam is also unacceptable; this includes posting links to irrelevant sites and repeatedly posting links to the same site. If someone is trolling or spamming, ignore and flag the user.": "As a primarily online-based community, it’s important we avoid the potentially negative aspects of the Internet.

    "If you feel someone — be it a new or longtime contributor — is coming off as rude, kindly let the person know. Getting out in front of issues before they compound is critical.

    "Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. If you're involved with an elementary-related project but feel you must remove yourself from it, do so in a way that minimizes disruption. When we work together, our work and ideas are no longer just our own; they belong to the elementary community as a whole. Inform other members of the team that you intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work. At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.": "Life priorities, interests, and passions can change.
