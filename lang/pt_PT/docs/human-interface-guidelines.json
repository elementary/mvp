    "Human Interface Guidelines": "Diretivas de Interface Humano (HIG)",
    "These guidelines are designed to help developers and designers create a beautifully consistent experience on the elementary desktop. They were written for interface designers, graphic artists and software developers who will be working on elementary OS. They will not only define specific design elements and principles, but will also instill a philosophy that will allow you to decide when it is appropriate to deviate from the Guidelines. Adhering to the suggestions contained here will provide many benefits:": "Estas orientações foram desenhadas para ajudar os developers e designers a criar experiências lindas e consistentes no ambiente do elementary. Foram escritas por designers de interfaces, artistas gráficos e programadores que trabalham no elementary OS. Não especificam simplesmente elementos de design e princípios, mas também tentarão promover uma filosofia que te vai ajudar a decidir quando é necessário um afastamento destas linhas. Aderir as sugestões aqui contidas vai-te trazer muitos benefícios:",
    "Users will learn to use your application faster because it shares common elements that they are already familiar with.": "Os utilizadores vão aprender rapidamente a usar as tuas apps já que partilham elementos comuns com que já estão ambientados.",
    "Users will accomplish tasks more quickly because you will have a straight-forward interface design that isn't confusing or difficult.": "Vão conseguir realizar tarefas mais rapidamente pois ofereceste um design na tua interface que não é difícil ou complicado.",
    "Your application will appear native to the desktop and share the same elegant look as default applications.": "A tua aplicação vai ter um aspecto nativo ao restante desktop e partilhar um aspecto tão elegante quanto as apps originais do sistema.",
    "Your application will be easier to document because an expected behavior does not require explanation.": "A tua aplicação será mais fácil de documentar pois um comportamento expectável não necessita de grande explicação.",
    "The amount of support you will have to provide, including bugs filed, will be lessened (for the reasons above).": "O nível de suporte que terás que oferecer, contando mesmo com os bugs, será mais reduzido (fruto dos anteriores)",
    "To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop. The most important thing to remember is that following these guidelines will make it easier to design a new application, not harder.": "Para te ajudar a atingir estes objectivos, estas guias vão cobrir os elementos base da interface, como os deves usar de forma eficiente, e como fazer a tua aplicação integrar com o restante desktop. A coisa mais importante que tens que te lembrar, é que estas linhas mestras estão cá para ajudar e não para complicar o teu trabalho.",
    "However, keep in mind that this is a guideline, not a rulebook. New, amazing interaction paradigms appear every day and more are waiting to be discovered. This is a living document that can and will be changed.": "No entanto, tenha em atenção que isto é uma linha de orientação, não um livro de regras. Novos, supreendentes paradigmas aparecerão cada dia e mais estarão à espera para serem descobertos. Isto é um documento vivo que pode e será alterado.",

As such, this very first portion of the guideline is all about the guiding philosophy we employ. For a quick crash course, we like &quot;The User is Drunk&quot;:": "Este documento não é apenas um conjunto concreto de regras; é suposto ser flexível e extensível. Como tal, esta primeira parte do documento é sobre a filosofia que usámos para nos guiar. Para uma introdução rápida gostamos disto \"The User is Drunk\":",
    "What Design Is Not": "O Que o Design Não É",
    "Before we get into all the things that make up elementary apps, there is a clarification that needs to be made. We need to understand what exactly design is about, but more importantly we want to smash two major myths:": "Antes de entrarmos naquilo que constitui as apps do elementary, há uma clarificação a fazer. Precisamos de perceber exactamente o que e o design. Mas primeiro queremos desmistificar dois dos grandes mitos do design:",
    "<strong>Design is not something you add on after you've completed a product.</strong> Whether you realize it or not, you are constantly designing anything you build. It is an intrinsic part of creating something. Design is not just what something looks like. It's not just the colors and fonts. Design is how it works. When you decide to add a button that does a thing, that is design. You made a decision to add a button with an icon or a label and where that button went and the size and color of that button. Decisions are designs.": "<strong>Design não é algo que se adicione no fim de ter um produto pronto</strong>. Caso não o compreendas, estás sempre a desenhar algo que queres construir. Isto é uma parte intrínseca de construir alguma coisa. Design não apenas o aspecto visual de uma coisa. Quando decides adicionar um botão que faz uma acção, isto é design. Tomaste uma decisão de acrescentar um botão, com um icone ou uma etiqueta de texto, onde este botão foi colocado, a sua dimensão e cor. Decidir é fazer design.",
    "<strong>Design is not <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/quotes?item=qt0464776\">just, like, your opinion, man.</a></strong> Design is testable. One design will meet a specific goal better than another design. Consider different types of bicycles. A folding bicycle has a different set of design goals than a mountain bicycle. Things like weight, size, and tire tread are important factors in helping the intended user reach their goals. Because we understand that design is about solving specific problems, we must also understand that we can objectively compare the effectiveness of two designs at solving those problems.": "<strong> Design não é <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/quotes?item=qt0464776\">a tua opinião!</a></strong> design é quantificável. Um design vai cumprir um objectivo de forma mais eficiente que outros. Pensa em tipos de bicicleta. Uma bicicleta dobrável tem um conjunto de objectivos de design diferentes de uma bicicleta de montanha. Coisas como a dimensão, peso, ou o tipo de pneu são factores importantes a ter em conta para os objectivos do utilizador. Como já compreendemos que o Design trata de resolver problemas específicos, temos também que compreender que podemos comparar a eficácia de dois designs a resolver estes problemas.",

You can do this in a number of ways, but one of the best ways is by sticking to a principal of concision.": "Trabalha sempre com o propósito de tornar a tua app imediatamente perceptível. A função principal da app deve ser evidente. Podes conseguir isto de uma série de maneiras, mas uma das melhores formas é manteres a app sob o princípio da concisão.",
    "Avoid Feature Bloat": "Evita funcionalidades em excesso",

Specifically, every time you add a new feature:": "é muitas vezes tentador continuar a adicionar mais e mais funcionalidades à tua app. No entanto, é primordial reconhecer que cada nova funcionalidade tem um preço. Especificamente, cada vez que adicionas uma nova funcionalidade:",

    "Your application's interface becomes more cluttered and thus harder to use.": "A interface de utilizador torna-se mais confusa, logo mais difícil de usar.",
    "More time is spent implementing this new feature, rather than perfecting an old feature.": "Gastas mais tempo a implementar esta nova funcionalidade em vez de estares a aperfeiçoar uma funcionalidade existente.",
    "More code can often mean a greater possibility for bugs.": "Mais código implica probabilidade maior de criares novos bugs.",

    "Think in Modules": "Pense em Módulos",
    "Build small, modular apps that communicate well. elementary apps avoid feature overlap and make their functions available to other apps either through <a href=\"#contractor\">Contractor</a> or over <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus\" title=\"View D-Bus docs from FreeDesktop.Org\">D-Bus</a>. This both saves you time as a developer (by other apps making their functions available to you), and is a courteous gesture towards other developers (by making your app's functions available to them).": "Cria apps pequenas e modulares que comuniquem bem. As apps do elementary evitam duplicar funcionalidades expõem as suas funcionalidades a outras apps quer seja através dos <a href=\"/docs/human-interface-guidelines/contractor\">Contractor</a> ou através do <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus\" title=\"View D-Bus docs from FreeDesktop.Org\">D-Bus</a>. Isto poupa-te tempo como programador (já que outras apps disponibilizam-te as suas funcionalidades), e é uma cortesia para com os outros programadores (expondo as tuas funcionalidades aos outros).",
    "Avoid Configuration": "Evitar Configuração",
    "If possible, completely avoid presenting any settings or configuration in your app. Providing settings is usually an easy way out of making design decisions about an app's behavior. But just like with problems of feature bloat, settings mean more code, more bugs, more testing, more documentation, and more complexity.": "Se possível, evita completamente exigir configurações ou preferências na tua app. Oferecer este tipo de conteúdo é normalmente uma forma fácil de fugir a decisão de fazer bom design sobre o comportamento da app. Mas tal como os problemas ou excesso de funcionalidades, preferências implicam  mais código, mais bugs, mais testes, mais documentação e mais complexidade.",
    "Build for the &quot;Out of The Box&quot; Experience": "Constrói a app para uma experiência imediata.",
    "Design with sane defaults in mind. elementary apps put strong emphasis on the out of the box experience. If your app has to be configured before a user is comfortable using it, they may not take the time to configure it at all and simply use another app instead.": "Desenha a app com as opções por omissão mais sensatas. As apps do elementary colocam um ênfase forte na experiência imediata. A tua app tem que estar configurada antes mesmo do utilizador estar confortável a usar, pois podem não querer gastar tempo a configurá-la, ou podem saltar logo para uma app alternativa.",
    "Ask the Operating System": "Pergunta ao Sistema Operativo.",
    "Get as much information automatically as possible. Instead of asking a user for their name or their location, ask the system for this information. This cuts down on the amount of things a user has to do and makes your app look intelligent and integrated.": "Obtém o máximo de informação possível de forma automática. Em vez de questionar o utilizador pelo seu nome e localização, tenta obter esta informação do sistema. Isto corta bastante o número de coisas que o utilizador tem que fazer, antes mesmo de usar a tua app, e faz a tua app parecer inteligente e integrada.",
    "Do You Really Need It?": "Precisa Mesmo?",
    "Ask yourself if the configuration option you are adding is really necessary or makes sense to a user. Don't ever ask users to make engineering or design decisions.": "Pergunta a ti mesmo se a opção de configuração que estás a acrescentar faz sentido para o utilizador. Não peças nunca ao utilizador par tomar decisões de design.",
    "When You Absolutely Have To": "Quando precisas mesmo de",

Instead of tucking away preferences in a configuration dialog, think about displaying them in context with the objects they affect (much like how shuffle and repeat options appear near your music library).": "Mantém as coisas contextualizadas. Em vez de esconderes preferencias numa caixa de diálogo específica, pensa em apresentá-las no contexto com os objectos que elas afetam. (e.g. as opções de shuffle ou repetir uma musica aparecem ao lado dos controlos da app de musica).",
    "If your app needs to be configured before it can be used (like a mail client), present this configuration inside the main window much like a <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Welcome Screen</a>. Once again, make sure this is really necessary set-up. Adding unnecessary configuration screens stops users from doing what they wanted to do when they opened your app in the first place.": "Se a tua app necessita de uma configuração antes de ser usada (e.g. um cliente de correio electrónico), apresenta esta configuração dentro da janela principal, como se tratasse de um <a href=\"/docs/human-interface-guidelines/welcome-screen\">ecrã de boas vindas</a>. Mais uma vez, certifica-te que esta configuração é mesmo necessária. Adicionar ecrãs de configuração desnecessários  desvia o utilizador do seu propósito inicial, que os levou a abrir a tua app.",

    "Provide non-technical explanations instead of cryptic error messages. If something goes wrong, a simplified explanation of what happened and how to fix it should be presented. ": "Inclui explicações não técnicas em vez de mensagens de erro crípticas.

    "User Workflow": "Workflow de Utilização",
    "Visible design is a large part of the user experience, but so is the user's workflow, or how they interact with an app. In this section, we cover a few important steps of a typical workflow:": "O design visível é uma grande parte da experiência de utilização, mas a forma como o utilizador interage com a aplicação - processo de trabalho- também o é. Nesta secção vamos cobrir alguns passos importantes de um processo de trabalho típico.",
    "<strong>First-Launch Experience</strong>: What the user sees the first time they use your app.": "<strong>Primeira utilização</strong>: O que o utilizador vê a primeira vez que usa a tua app.",
    "<strong>Normal Launch</strong>: What happens when opening your app on a day-to-day basis.": "<strong>Utilização Normal</strong>: O que acontece quando o utilizador usa a tua app numa base diária.",
    "<strong>Closing</strong>: What happens when closing your app.": "<strong>Encerramento</strong>: O que acontece quando se encerra a app;",
    "<strong>Background Tasks</strong>: How your app manages to do things invisibly in the background.": "<strong>Tarefas em background</strong>: Como a tua app lida com as tarefas que tem que realizar fora do focus.",
    "First-Launch Experience": "Experiência de Primeiro-Lançamento",
    "Required Configuration": "Configuração Requerida",
    "When a user first launches an app, they should be able to get down to business as quickly as possible. If configuration is not absolutely required for the first use, they should not be required to configure anything. If configuration is required (like in Postler), they should be presented with a clean and simple <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen</a> within the app (again, like Postler). Avoid separate configuration dialogs when launching.": "Quando um utilizador lança a tua app pela primeira vez, tem que a poder usar o mais rapidamente possível. Se uma configuração não é estritamente necessária na primeira utilização, então não deverá ser apresentada ou exigida. Se esta configuração é necessária (como por exemplo no Postler), esta deverá ser apresentada com uma interface simples e limpa do tipo <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Ecrã de Boas Vindas</a> dentro da app (mais uma vez, como o exemplo do Postler). Evita caixas de diálogo autónomas no processo de arranque.",
    "Speed of Launch": "Velocidade de Lançamento",
    "Your app's first launch is the user's first impression of your app; it's a chance to really show off its design and speed. If your app has to configure things in the background before visibly launching, it gives the user the impression that the app is slow or will take a long time to start up. Instead, focus on making the application window appear fast and ready to be used, then do any background tasks behind the scenes. If the background task is blocking (ie. the user is unable to perform certain tasks until it's complete), show some type of indication that a background process is happening and make the blocked user interface items insensitive (see: <a href=\"#widget-concepts\">Widget Concepts</a>).": "A primeira vez que o utilizador corre a tua app, é quando fica com a primeira impressão; É a melhor altura para mostrares o quão bem desenhada está e a sua fluidez. Se a tua app precisa de configurar coisas em plano de fundo, antes de lançar visualmente a interface, vai dar ao utilizador a impressão de que é lenta, ou que vai demorar sempre imenso tempo a arrancar. Deves-te focar em fazer a janela da app aparecer rapidamente, e pronta a usar, e a fazer as tarefas em background, por detrás do pano. Se estas tarefas estão a bloquear a utilização (e.g. o utilizador não pode usar algumas das suas funcionalidades), mostra algum tipo de indicação de que estão a ocorrer estas tarefas longe da vista, e tira a \"sensibilidade\" aos items da interface que não vão responder (ver <a href=\"#widget-concepts\">Conceitos de Widgets</a>).",
    "Welcoming the User": "Dar as Boas Vindas ao Utilizador",
    "If there is no content to show the user, provide actions they can act upon by using a simple <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen</a>. Allow them to open a document, add an account, import a CD, or whatever makes sense in the context of the app.": "Se não há conteúdo para exibir, disponibiliza acções que o utilizador possa desempenhar usando um <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">Ecrã de boas vindas</a>. Permite-lhes abrir um documento, adicionar uma conta, importar um CD, ou o que fizer mais sentido no contexto da tua app.",
    "Resetting the App": "Restabelecer a App",
    "If a user explicitly &quot;resets&quot; the app (ex. by deleting all songs in a music library or removing all mail accounts in a mail client), it should return to its first-launch state.": "Se um utilizador faz um \"reset\" explícito da aplicação (e.g. apagando todas as músicas da biblioteca, ou removendo todas as contas de e-mail) deverás apresentar a app no seu estado inicial.",
    "Normal Launch": "Lançamento Normal",
    "When a user launches an app, they're performing an explicit action and expecting a fast, oftentimes immediate response. You should focus on three key areas for app launching: speed, obviousness of what to do next, and state.": "Quando um utilizador lança uma aplicação, estão a realizar uma acção explícita e esperam uma resposta rápida, senão imediata. Deverás enfocar-te em três áreas principais no lançamento: Velocidade, O que fazer a seguir - tem que ser óbvio - e o estado.",
    "Speed": "Rapidez",
    "As has been said before, speed, especially when launching an app, is very important. There should be as little delay as possible in between the time a user decides to launch an app and the instant they can begin using it. If your app requires a splash screen, you're doing it wrong.": "Como já foi dito antes, a rapidez, especialmente ao lançar uma aplicação, é muito importante. Deve haver tão pouco atraso quanto possível entre o momento em que um utilizador decide lançar uma aplicação e o instante em que pode começar a usá-la. Se a tua aplicação requer uma tela de arranque, é porque não estás a fazê-la bem.",
    "Obviousness": "Evidência",
    "When a user launches your app, they should know exactly what to do next. This is achieved by following the other interface guidelines (ensuring your app is consistent with other apps) and by offering up explicit actions from the get go. If the app typically displays &quot;items,&quot; such as songs or emails, let the user get at those items by displaying them when the app opens. If there are no previously-opened items, you should offer to open or create a new item (such as a document) by using a <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">welcome screen</a>.": "Quando o utilizador lança a tua app, tem que lhe ser evidente o que fazer a seguir. Isto é conseguido seguindo as outras linhas mestras do design (assegurando que a app é consistente com as demais) e demonstrando de forma evidente quais as acções disponíveis logo à partida. Se a app apresenta items, como músicas ou e-mails, dê acesso direto aos vários items existente mostrando-os assim que a app lança. Se não existirem items abertos de sessões anteriores, deverá propor abrir um item, ou criar um novo item (e.g. um documento) usando um <a href=\"#welcome-screen\">ecrã de boas vindas</a>.",
    "State": "Estado",
    "If the user has previously used your app, it's typically best to restore the state of the app when opening it again. This means the app comes up to right where the user left off so they can pick up their work again. For a music player, this means opening up with the view where the user left it and the song paused where the user closed the app. For a document editor, this would mean opening up with the same document scrolled to the same spot with the cursor in the same spot on the page.": "Se o utilizador já usou previamente a tua app, tipicamente o melhor será restaurar a sessão ao estado em que este a deixou. Isto significa que a app deve aparecer aberta exatametne onde o utilizador a deixou para que este possa seguir caminho. No caso de uma aplicação de música, deve abrir na última view, e a música que tocava na altura deverá estar em pause. Num editor de documentos, isto significa abrir no mesmo documento, e com o cursor exatamente na mesma posição na página.",
    "Always Provide An Undo": "Proporcione Sempre Um Voltar Atrás",
    "Sometimes a user will perform an action which could possibly be destructive or traditionally irreversible. Rather than present the user with a warning, apps should allow the user to undo the action for an appropriate amount of time. Some prime examples of when this behavior is useful are:": "Por vezes um utilizador pode levar a cabo uma acção destrutiva ou irreversível. Em vez de apresentar um aviso, as aplicações devem apresentar uma hipótese para desfazer as alterações, durante um intervalo de tempo apropriado. Alguns exemplos óptimos deste comportamento são:",
    "<strong>Closing an app</strong>. Rather than warning the user, automatically save their work and the app's state so they can return exactly where they left off. See <a href=\"#closing\">Closing</a>.": "<strong>Fechar a app</Strong>. Em vez de questionar o utilizador, grave automaticamente o trabalho realizado e o estado da aplicação para que possa regressar exatamente ao sítio onde fecharam a aplicação. Vê mais em <a href=\"#closing\">Fechando</a>.",
    "<strong>Deleting an item</strong>. Instead of asking the user if they are sure, make the item &quot;disappear&quot; from the app, but provide an easy and intuitive way to undo the delete.": "<strong>Apagar um item</strong>. Em vez de questionar o utilizador se tem a certeza, faça o item desaparecer da aplicação, mas providencie uma forma fácil e intuitiva de reverter esta acção.",
    "<strong>Sending an email</strong>. Rather than asking the user if they want to send an email, allow them to undo or edit the message a short time after &quot;sending.&quot;": "<strong>enviar um email</strong>. Em vez de questionar o utilizador se quer enviar o e-mail, dê-lhe a possibilidade de interromper o envio, ou editar a mensagem durante um certo tempo após carregar no \"enviar\".",
    "<strong>Editing a photo</strong>. Instead of asking the user if they want to destructively apply an edit, allow them to undo the edit and always keep the original backed up.": "<strong>Editar uma fotografia</strong>. Em vez de questionar o utilizador se pretende editar destrutivamente o original ao aplicar uma alteração, permita-lhe reverter a alteração, e mantenha o original em segurança numa pasta ao lado.",
    "This behavior should only as a last resort be implemented by providing a buffer time between when the app shows the user what happened and actually performing the action. To keep the experience responsive, the app should always look as if it performed the action as soon as the user initiates it. ": "Este comportamento deve ser usado apenas em situações especiais, implementando um tempo de buffer reduzido entre o dar a indicação de realizar a acção e o realizar a mesma. Este comportamento vai contra a ideia de se manter a experiência rápida/imediata, em que a app deverá apresentar-se sempre como se a acção se realizasse assim que o utilizador dá esta instrução. ",
    "This behavior strikes the best balance of keeping out of the user's way while making sure they don't do something unintended. It's important to keep the undo action unobtrusive yet simple and intuitive; a common way of doing so is by using an info bar, though other methods may also be appropriate.": "Este comportamento consegue o melhor equilíbrio entre manter-se fora do caminho dos utilizadores enquanto se certifica que eles não fazem algo que não seja intencional. É importante manter a ação desfazer inobtrusiva mas no entanto simples e intuitiva; uma maneira comum de o fazer é usar uma barra de informação, embora outros métodos possam também ser apropriados.",

    "Always Saved": "Sempre Guardado",
    "Users should feel confident when using elementary; they should know that everything they see is saved and up to date.": "Os utilizadores deve sentir-se confiantes quando usarem elementary; devem saber que tudo o que veem é guardado e atualizado.",
    "Apps in elementary should operate around an always-saved state. This means that changes the user makes are instantly applied and visible and that making the user manually save things is a legacy or specialized behavior.": "As apps no elementary devem operar em volta de um estado sempre-guardado. Isto significa que alterações que o utilizador faça são instantaneamente aplicadas e visíveis; que fazer o utilizador guardar manualmente coisas é um comportamento antigo ou uma especificidade.",
    "For example, a Song Info dialog should update the track information instantly without a user having to press a save button, user preferences should be applied as soon as the user manipulates the relevant widget, and closing an app should mean that reopening it will return to where the user left off.": "Por exemplo, um diálogo de Informação de Música deve atualizar a informação da faixa instantaneamente, sem que o utilizador tenha de pressionar o botão de guardar; preferências de utilizador devem ser aplicadas logo que o utilizador manipula o widget relevante, e fechar uma app deve significar que reabri-la retornará o utilizador ao ponto onde a deixou.",
    "Closing": "A fechar",
    "When a user closes an app, it's typically because they're done using it for now and they want to get it out of the way.": "Quando um utilizador fecha uma app, é tipicamente porque já acabou de desempenhar a tarefa em mãos, e quer que a app saia do caminho.",
    "Saving State": "Guardar o Estado",
    "Apps should save their current state when closed so they can be reopened right to where the user left off. Ideally closing and reopening an app should be indistinguishable from the traditional concept of minimizing and unminimizing an app; that is, all elements should be saved including open documents, scroll position, undo history, etc.": "As apps devem gravar o seu estado quando são fechadas para que possam ser reabertas exatamente no sítio onde o utilizador as deixou. Idealmente isto não deverá ser diferente de minimizar e maximizar a app; ou seja todos os elementos deverão ser gravados, inclusivamente documentos, o ponto do scroll, o historico de reversão de acções, etc.",
    "Background Tasks": "Tarefas de Segundo Plano",
    "If it makes sense for an app to complete background tasks after the window is closed, the tasks should be completed soon after the window is closed. If the app performs repeat background tasks (such as a mail client), the background tasks should be handled by a separate daemon that does not rely on the app itself being open.": "Se fizer sentido que a app complete tarefas de background depois da janela fechada, estas deverão ser realizadas no imediato. Se a a app realiza tarefas repetitivas (e.g. um cliente de e-mail), as tarefas de background deverão ser realizadas por um daemon em separado que não dependa do estado da aplicação principal.",
    "Closing the App Window": "Fechar a Janela da App",
    "It is not desirable for an app window to simply minimize rather than close when the user attempts to close it. Instead, the app window should be &quot;hidden&quot;. If it makes sense to continue a process in the background (such as downloading/transferring, playing music, or executing a terminal command) the app backend should continue with the task and close when the task is finished. If it's not immediately apparent that the process has completed (as with the file download/transfer or terminal command), the app may show a notification informing the user that the process has completed. If it is apparent, as with the music, no notification is necessary.": "Não é desejável que uma janela de app simplesmente minimize em vez de fechar quando o utilizador a tenta fechar. Em vez disso a janela da app deve ficar \"escondida\". Se fizer sentido para continuar um processo nos bastidores (tal como descarregar/transferir, tocar música, ou executar um comando do terminal) o bastidor da app deve continuar com a tarefa e fechar quando a tarefa estiver concluída. Se não for imediatamente aparente que o processo completou (como no descarregar/transferir ou comando do terminal), a app pode mostrar uma notificação informando o utilizador que o processo completou. Se for aparente, tal como na música, nenhuma notificação é necessária.",
    "Re-Opening the App Window": "Re-Abertura da Janela da App",
    "If the user re-opens the app while the background process is still executing, the app should be exactly where it would be if the window had been open the whole time. For example, the terminal should show any terminal output, the music player should be on the same page it was when closed, and the browser should come back to the page it was on previously. For more details, see the discussion of app state on a <a href=\"#normal-launch\">Normal Launch</a>.": "Se o utilizador re-abrir a app enquanto o processo de bastidor ainda estiver em execução, a app deve ser estar exactamente no sítio onde deveria de estar se a janela estivesse estado aberta durante o tempo todo.
