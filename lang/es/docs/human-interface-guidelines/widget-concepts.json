    "A very common mistake for developers to make is creating controls that seemingly do nothing. Keep in mind that we want to present an environment where users feel comfortable exploring. A curious user will interact with a control expecting there to be some immediate reaction. When a control seemingly does nothing, this creates confusion and can be scary (Think,  &quot;uh-oh I don't know what happened!&quot;). In some cases, controls that do nothing are simply clutter and add unnecessary complexity to your UI.": "A very common mistake for developers to make is creating controls that seemingly do nothing.
