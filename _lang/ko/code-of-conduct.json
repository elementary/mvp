    "Code of Conduct": "행동 지침",
    "Community Guidelines": "커뮤니티 지침",
    "Being involved in the elementary community is an incredible experience; you get to be a part of something big, collaborate with people from around the world, and help people make their computers awesome. However, with that comes a responsibility to follow a predefined set of rules that ensures the best environment for all involved. The following rules are expected to be adhered to anytime you’re involved with the community, be it on the elementary website, in an official IRC room, in person, or elsewhere.": "",
    "I. Respect": "I. 존중",
    "Respecting others is paramount. Be sure to respect people and their opinions, personal background, privacy, and ideas. The elementary community is not a place for disrespectful or hurtful remarks for any reason whatsoever. When giving criticism, approach it constructively and respectfully. Personal attacks are not tolerated. When receiving constructive criticism, take it into consideration and thank the critic for their input, no matter your stance.": "다른 사람들을 존중하는 것이 가장 중요합니다. 사람과 그들의 의견, 개인적인 배경, 개인 정보 및 아이디어를 존중해야 합니다. elementary 공동체는 어떤 이유로든 불손하거나 상처를 주는 말을 하는 곳이 아닙니다. 비판을 할 때는 건설적이고 존중하게 접근하십시오. 개인적인 공격은 용인되지 않습니다. 건설적인 비판을 받을 땐 그것을 고려하고, 입장에 상관없이 그들의 제안과 비평에 고마워합시다.",
    "II. Content": "II. 내용",
    "The elementary community is made up of thousands of users of varying ages, beliefs, and levels of maturity. Because of this, you must be conscious of the content you produce and the remarks you make. No nudity, excess vulgarity, political content, religious content, or inappropriate content should appear in relation to elementary. Ultimately, the elementary moderators have the final say as to what constitutes as inappropriate. If in doubt, consider whether or not it’s something you’d show to a room full of people including children and grandmothers from around the world. If you’re hesitant, don’t do it.": "",
    "Screenshots shared in elementary-moderated communities should not contain themes that imitate another OS, photos or illustrations objectifying an individual, or content that otherwise violates our Code of Conduct.": "중도 elementary 공동체에서 나누는 스크린샷에는 다른 OS를 모방하는 주제, 개인을 대상화하는 사진 또는 일러스트레이션, 또는 행동 강령을 위반하는 콘텐츠가 포함되어서는 안 됩니다.",
    "III. Rumors and Speculation": "III. 소문과 추측",
    "While the fast-paced and exciting nature of elementary contributes to the want to spread rumors or speculation, avoid it. Discussing future plans is alright, but anytime it’s not a verified fact, disclose it as personal speculation or do not discuss it. Spreading inaccurate information can be detrimental to the community, especially if spread in a negative light.": "",
    "IV. Helpful Discussion": "IV. 유용한 토론",
    "elementary is powered by individuals coming together in their free time to create something special. It’s important to respect that fact and to always try to contribute to healthy, helpful discussion. If in a meeting, keep on-topic and stay quiet unless you have something helpful that pertains to the immediate discussion. If commenting on the website, keep the discussion related to the content of the Journal entry or Answer topic. If participating in a developer-oriented discussion such as a mailing list or developer IRC channel, do not create unnecessary noise by discussing non-development topics; this only derails the discussion and muddies up the logs for developers who may not be present.": "",
    "As a primarily online-based community, it’s important we avoid the potentially negative aspects of the Internet. Do not troll; starting fights or making remarks with the sole purpose of making someone mad is childish and unacceptable. Spam is also unacceptable; this includes posting links to irrelevant sites and repeatedly posting links to the same site. If someone is trolling or spamming, ignore and flag the user.": "",
    "V. Avoiding Conflict": "V. 불필요한 다툼 피하기",
    "If you feel someone — be it a new or longtime contributor — is coming off as rude, kindly let the person know. Getting out in front of issues before they compound is critical. Everyone has a role to play in helping communication flow smoothly in our (sometimes challengingly) unique work environment.": "누군가가 — 그 사람이 처음 기여하는 사람이던 오랫동안 기여를 해왔던 사람이던 — 무례한 것처럼 느껴지면, 친절하게 그 사람에게 알리십시오. 문제가 되기 전에 문제를 해결하는 것이 중요합니다. 모든 사람들은 우리의 독창적인 업무 환경에서 원활하게 (때로는 도전적으로) 커뮤니케이션이 이루어지도록 서로 돕고 있습니다.",
    "VI. Step Down Considerately": "VI. 신중하게 자리 내어주기",
    "Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. If you're involved with an elementary-related project but feel you must remove yourself from it, do so in a way that minimizes disruption. When we work together, our work and ideas are no longer just our own; they belong to the elementary community as a whole. Inform other members of the team that you intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work. At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.": "삶의 우선순위, 관심사 및 열정이 바뀔 수 있습니다.  당신이 elementary 관련 프로젝트에 관여하고 있지만 그것으로부터 물러나야 한다고 생각한다면, 혼란을 최소화하는 방법으로 그렇게 하십시오. 우리가 함께 일할 땐, 우리의 일과 생각은 더 이상 우리들 만의 것은 아닙니다; 그 모든 것은 elementary 공동체에 속합니다. 다른 팀원들에게 당신의 사임 의사를 전하고, 가능하다면, 당신의 일을 대신할 만한 사람을 찾도록 도와주십시오. 적어도, 당신이 떠나도 당신이 하던 일은 그대로 계속될 수 있도록 만들어주시기 바랍니다.",
    "Consequences": "결론",
    "If you choose not to follow this code of conduct or otherwise disrupt the community, we reserve the right to do the following: alter or remove any content you’ve posted; deactivate your account on the website; kick you out of an IRC channel; ban you from the site, IRC channels, or related services; or otherwise prevent you from interacting with the community.": "",
