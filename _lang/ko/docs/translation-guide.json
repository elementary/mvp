    "Localizing our website and apps is a very important part of making elementary OS available to as many people as possible. Instead of relying solely on an internal translation team, we use crowdsourcing so that anyone can submit translations with little to no technical knowledge. In order to keep our voice consistent across the entire platform, and to help new translators get started, we’ve put together this translation guide.": "웹 사이트와 앱을 현지화하는 것은 가능한 한 많은 사람들이 elementary OS를 사용할 수 있게 만드는 매우 중요한 부분입니다. 내부 번역 팀에 의존하는 대신 우리는 크라우드 소싱을 통해 기술 지식이 거의 없거나 전혀 없이도 누구나 번역을 제출할 수 있도록 하고 있습니다. 우리의 뜻을 전체 플랫폼에서 일관되게 유지하고 새로운 번역 참여자들을 돕기 위해 이 번역 지침을 정리했습니다.",
