    "Code of Conduct": "行動規範",
    "Community Guidelines": "コミュニティのガイドライン",
    "Being involved in the elementary community is an incredible experience; you get to be a part of something big, collaborate with people from around the world, and help people make their computers awesome. However, with that comes a responsibility to follow a predefined set of rules that ensures the best environment for all involved. The following rules are expected to be adhered to anytime you’re involved with the community, be it on the elementary website, in an official IRC room, in person, or elsewhere.": "",
    "I. Respect": "1. 尊重",
    "Respecting others is paramount. Be sure to respect people and their opinions, personal background, privacy, and ideas. The elementary community is not a place for disrespectful or hurtful remarks for any reason whatsoever. When giving criticism, approach it constructively and respectfully. Personal attacks are not tolerated. When receiving constructive criticism, take it into consideration and thank the critic for their input, no matter your stance.": "他人を尊重することはとても重要です。人と自分との意見、個人的な背景やプライバシー、考えを尊重するようにしてください。elementary コミュニティは、理由の如何を問わず失礼や人を傷つけるような発言のための場所ではありません。批判を与えた場合、建設的かつ丁重にそれに近づいていきます。個人への攻撃は容認されていません。建設的な批判を受けたときは、考慮にそれを取ると関係なく、彼らの入力のためのあなたのスタンスとして持論を持つ事には感謝していません。",
    "II. Content": "2. コンテンツ",
    "The elementary community is made up of thousands of users of varying ages, beliefs, and levels of maturity. Because of this, you must be conscious of the content you produce and the remarks you make. No nudity, excess vulgarity, political content, religious content, or inappropriate content should appear in relation to elementary. Ultimately, the elementary moderators have the final say as to what constitutes as inappropriate. If in doubt, consider whether or not it’s something you’d show to a room full of people including children and grandmothers from around the world. If you’re hesitant, don’t do it.": "",
    "Screenshots shared in elementary-moderated communities should not contain themes that imitate another OS, photos or illustrations objectifying an individual, or content that otherwise violates our Code of Conduct.": "elementary-moderated コミュニティで共有するスクリーンショットには、客観的に行動規範に違反する個人またはコンテンツ、他のOS、写真やイラスト、模倣したテーマを含めることはできません。",
    "III. Rumors and Speculation": "3. 噂・憶測",
    "While the fast-paced and exciting nature of elementary contributes to the want to spread rumors or speculation, avoid it. Discussing future plans is alright, but anytime it’s not a verified fact, disclose it as personal speculation or do not discuss it. Spreading inaccurate information can be detrimental to the community, especially if spread in a negative light.": "",
    "IV. Helpful Discussion": "4. ディスカッションの参考",
    "elementary is powered by individuals coming together in their free time to create something special. It’s important to respect that fact and to always try to contribute to healthy, helpful discussion. If in a meeting, keep on-topic and stay quiet unless you have something helpful that pertains to the immediate discussion. If commenting on the website, keep the discussion related to the content of the Journal entry or Answer topic. If participating in a developer-oriented discussion such as a mailing list or developer IRC channel, do not create unnecessary noise by discussing non-development topics; this only derails the discussion and muddies up the logs for developers who may not be present.": "",
    "As a primarily online-based community, it’s important we avoid the potentially negative aspects of the Internet. Do not troll; starting fights or making remarks with the sole purpose of making someone mad is childish and unacceptable. Spam is also unacceptable; this includes posting links to irrelevant sites and repeatedly posting links to the same site. If someone is trolling or spamming, ignore and flag the user.": "",
    "V. Avoiding Conflict": "5. 紛争の回避",
    "If you feel someone — be it a new or longtime contributor — is coming off as rude, kindly let the person know. Getting out in front of issues before they compound is critical. Everyone has a role to play in helping communication flow smoothly in our (sometimes challengingly) unique work environment.": "あなたが誰かを感じた場合 — それは新たなユーザーまたは長年の貢献者 ー 不親切、失礼など人に知らせ、彼らの化合によって問題を得る事が重要である前に、誰もがコミュニケーションが(時には挑戦的に)ユニークな作業環境にスムーズに流れる上で果たすべき役割を持っています。",
    "VI. Step Down Considerately": "6. ステップダウンの思いやり",
    "Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. If you're involved with an elementary-related project but feel you must remove yourself from it, do so in a way that minimizes disruption. When we work together, our work and ideas are no longer just our own; they belong to the elementary community as a whole. Inform other members of the team that you intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work. At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.": "あなたの生活の優先順位や興味はもちろん変更することができます。elementary関連のプロジェクトに関わっていても、それは同じです。あなたがもし辞任する予定がある場合はチームの他のメンバーに通知し、可能な場合は、作業を引き継いでくれるメンバーを見つけて下さい。少なくとも、あなたが中断したところから作業を継続できる事を確認して下さい。",
    "Consequences": "結果",
    "If you choose not to follow this code of conduct or otherwise disrupt the community, we reserve the right to do the following: alter or remove any content you’ve posted; deactivate your account on the website; kick you out of an IRC channel; ban you from the site, IRC channels, or related services; or otherwise prevent you from interacting with the community.": "",
