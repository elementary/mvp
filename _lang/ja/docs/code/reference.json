This would be a great place to bookmark and refer back to when you have questions about elementary development.": "今、あなたはチャンピオンのような開発者ガイドを通して、私たちはあなたのためにいくつかの参考資料を持っています。これは、ブックマークには絶好の場所である、あなたは基本開発について質問があるときに戻って参照することになり。",
    "Code Style": "コードスタイル",
    "The purpose of this guide is to provide clean and accurate instructions on\nwriting good code across all elementary projects. This guideline is to be\nfollowed on every file, in order to keep our code consistent and readable. We\nare also inheriting some of the GNOME's Vala guidelines to keep our code\nconsistent with other Vala programs.": "このガイドの目的は、全ての elementary プロジェクトで良いコードを書くためのクリーンで正確なインストラクションを提供することです。このガイドラインは、コードの一貫性と可読性を保つために、全てのファイルで従うべきです。私たちはまた、私たちのコードが他の Vala プログラムと一貫性を保つため、 GNOME の Vala ガイドラインの幾つかを継承しています。",
    "If the guidelines here proposed are followed, newcomers to elementary\ndevelopment will be more easily able to join the development and\nunderstand code. Besides, it'll make it easier for all developers to work on\napplications that they don't usually work on, because the code will be\nconsistent. Finally, as Guido Van Rossum said - &quot;Code is much more often read\nthan written&quot;, so having nicely written code is crucial.": "ここで提案されているガイドラインに従っていると、elementary 開発の新規参入者は、開発に参加することとコードを理解することがより簡単になるでしょう。加えて、コードに一貫性があるため、全ての開発者が普段は取り組んでいないアプリケーションに取り組むこともより簡単になるでしょう。最後に、 Guido Van Rossum  が言ったとおり - \"Code is much more often read than written\" 、うまく書かれたコードを持つことは非常に重要です。",
    "Whitespace": "空白",
    "There is no trailing whitespace at the end of a line, whether it's empty or\nnot. There is also no empty line after declaring a function:": "行の終わりの余分な空白は、それが空かどうかに関わらず、ありません。関数宣言後の空行もありません。",
    "White space comes before opening parentheses:": "開き括弧の前に空白文字が入ります:",
    "Whitespace goes in all maths-related code, between numbers and operators.": "全ての数学関連のコードで、数と演算子の間に、空白文字が入ります。",
    "Indentation": "インデント",
    "Vala code is indented using 4 spaces for consistency and readability.": "Valaのコードは一貫性と可読性のために4つのスペースを使ってインデントされます。",

    "Cuddled else and else if:": "くっついた else と else if:",

    "Separate code into classes for easier extensibility.": "容易な拡張性のためにコードを複数のクラスに分けてください。",
    "Comments": "コメント",
    "Comments are either on the same line as the code or in a special line.": "コメントはコードと同じ行か特別な行のどちらでも良いです。",
    "Comments are indented alongside the code, and obvious comments do more harm\nthan good.": "コメントは、コードと一緒にインデントします。自明はコメントは有害無益です。",
    "Variable names, class names, function names": "変数名、クラス名、関数名",
    "Also worth referring that there should be no Hungarian notation, and no mix of\nany kinds of notations.": "ハンガリアン記法は存在するべきではないということ、複数の記法を混ぜるべきではないことも言及する価値があります。",
    "Casting": "キャスト",
    "Avoid using <code>as</code> keyword when casting as it might give <code>null</code> as result, which could be easily forgotten to check.": "結果として <code>null</code> を返すかもしれないキャストでは <code>as</code> を使うことを避けてください。これは、チェックすることを忘れがちです。",
    "Use of '=' in place of 'set'": "'set' の代わりに '=' を使う",
    "In places or operations where you would otherwise use <code>set</code> , you should make use of <code>=</code> instead.": "<code>set</code>を使う場所や操作では、代わりに <code>=</code> を使うようにするべきです。",

    "Columns per line": "行あたりの幅",
    "Ideally, lines should have no more than 80 characters per line, because this\nis the default terminal size. However, as an exception, more characters could\nbe added, because most people have wide-enough monitors nowadays. The hard\nlimit is 120 characters.": "理想的には各行は1行あたり80文字以上を持つべきではありません。これは\nデフォルトのターミナルサイズのためです。しかし、例外として、より多くの文字\nを追加できます。今日ほとんどの人が十分幅のあるモニターを持っているためです。\nハードリミットは120文字です。",
