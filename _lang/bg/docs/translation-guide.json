    "Localizing our website and apps is a very important part of making elementary OS available to as many people as possible. Instead of relying solely on an internal translation team, we use crowdsourcing so that anyone can submit translations with little to no technical knowledge. In order to keep our voice consistent across the entire platform, and to help new translators get started, we’ve put together this translation guide.": "",

    "Once you’ve selected a project, you can provide suggestions for strings that have not yet been translated, or suggest changes to strings that have already been translated. These suggestions will be evaluated by a translation team member and they will choose the most appropriate one. For a more information about Weblate, you can refer to their <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.weblate.org\/en\/weblate-3.0.1\/user\/index.html\">documentation<\/a>.": "",

    "When translating you may encounter a situation where you have to decide between several ways of saying the same thing. In these situations we refer to the Ubuntu <a href=\"https:\/\/help.launchpad.net\/Translations\/Guide\">general translator guide<\/a>, and for language specific issues we follow Ubuntu's <a href=\"https:\/\/translations.launchpad.net\/+groups\/ubuntu-translators\">team translation guidelines<\/a>.
