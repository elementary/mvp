    "Localizing our website and apps is a very important part of making elementary OS available to as many people as possible. Instead of relying solely on an internal translation team, we use crowdsourcing so that anyone can submit translations with little to no technical knowledge. In order to keep our voice consistent across the entire platform, and to help new translators get started, we’ve put together this translation guide.": "翻譯我們的網站和程式在普及elementary OS的過程中有着舉足輕重的作用。我們選擇讓大眾來幫助我們翻譯，而不是通過自己效率低下的內部翻譯團隊來翻譯，從而使有着極少甚至沒有相關知識的人也能參與其中。為了讓整個平臺能夠展現并保持最新的本地化內容，我們編寫了這份翻譯指導以幫助你高效地完成你的翻譯工作。",
