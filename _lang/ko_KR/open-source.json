    "The elementary OS platform is built upon a strong foundation of Free & Open Source software. Without projects such as these, elementary OS would not exist.": "",
    "Security & Privacy": "",
    "By being Open Source, elementary OS can benefit from superior security and privacy over closed source software. When the source code is available to audit, anyone in the community — whether a security researcher, a concerned user, or an OEM shipping the OS on their hardware — can ensure the software is secure and not collecting or leaking personal information.": "",
    "Better for Developers": "",
    "If your app could benefit from a system API or feature that’s not yet available, you can help write that feature into the OS. Similarly, you might be curious as to how a feature or design pattern in elementary OS was made. Instead of guessing or trying to reimplement it on your own, you can just look at the underlying source code for a definitive answer.": "",
